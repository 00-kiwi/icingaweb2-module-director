Icinga Director
===============

Icinga Director has been designed to make Icinga 2 configuration handling easy.
It tries to target two main audiences:

* Users with the desire to completely automate their datacenter
* Sysops willing to grant their "point & click" users a lot of flexibility

What makes Icinga Director so special is the fact that it tries to target both
of them at once.
